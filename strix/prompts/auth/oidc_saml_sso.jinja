Title: OIDC/SAML/SSO Authentication Playbook

Goals:
- Validate OIDC/SAML login flows, session handling, and token misuse.
- Identify insecure redirect URIs, weak token validation, and replay risks.

Checklist:
- Map identity flow: discovery endpoints (.well-known/openid-configuration), authz URL, token URL, JWKS, ACS/SSO endpoints.
- Try login with controlled redirect_uri and response_mode/form_post vs query to detect open redirect/exfil.
- Inspect tokens (id/access) for alg=none, kid confusion, missing aud/iss/exp/nbf/iat checks; attempt forged token with wrong kid.
- Test SAML: unsigned/assertion wrapping, replay (multiple submissions), relaxed Recipient/Audience/NotOnOrAfter.
- Evaluate session fixation and cookie flags (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) post-login.
- Fuzz return_to/RelayState/state/redirect_uri for open redirect or code leakage.
- Verify logout/invalidation: token revocation endpoints, backchannel/frontchannel logout.
- Check MFA/step-up enforcement and device binding if claimed.

Tools:
- Prefer browser/proxy for auth flows; capture network requests and response timing.
- Use terminal/python tools only for inspecting tokens and JWKS responses; avoid hitting prod identity endpoints with aggressive fuzzing.

Cautions:
- Do not brute-force passwords.
- Do not send tokens to external endpoints.
- Keep all tokens in workspace; redact before sharing.
